# STSdb 4.0

STSdb 4.0 is a NoSQL key-value store open-source database with innovative indexing algorithm. The STSdb 4.0 engine is based on WaterfallTree technology which provides blazing performance in real-time indexing of both sequential and random keys, making STSdb 4.0 perfect for BigData and enterprise systems.

# Key Features

## Innovative Technology
The storage engine of STSdb 4.0 is based on an innovative data indexing structure called WaterfallTree. WaterfallTree is an algorithm that effectively solves one of the fundamental problems in the database world – speed degradation when indexing random keys.
